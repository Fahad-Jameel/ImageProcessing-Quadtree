# ImageProcessing-Quadtree
This program execute image processing using data structure concepts

1) Part-1: in part one it read image and and store it into the array and 2d linked list. Then it apply quadtree algorithm on it after that it store into the txt file
2) Part-2: In this part it read the store data in file to apply quadtree again on it and then recontruct the image after all processing
3) Part-3: In this part it check the similarty level between the original image and reconstructed image
